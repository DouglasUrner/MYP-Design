Unit 3: Web Design
==================

__Course:__ Exploring Computer Science

Unit plan for the ECS Web Design unit (unit 3) being taught as a Design class as part of an MYP year 4/5 program.

## Resources:

* [Growing Up Online](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/kidsonline) – WGBH documentary (2008) on the first generation to the first generation to grow up immersed in an online world.

 Show first three (about 24 minutes total).

 * Living Their Lives Essentially Online (7:35)
 * A Revolution in Classrooms and Social Life (9:04)
 * Self Expression, Trying On New Identities (7:17)

 Link contains all sections.

 * Do you have to "keep up" with the Internet?
 * The report is from 2008. How accurate does it seem to be?

## Topic:

__Key Concept:__ Communication

__Related Concepts:__ Evolution, Form

__Global Context:__

__Statement of Inquiry:__ The evolution of ubiquitous, world-wide, communication following the invention of the Internet and the World Wide Web.

### Inquiry Questions

* __Factual:__
 * What are the ideas and innovations that make the Internet, and the World Wide Web possible?
* __Conceptual:__
 * How is online communication like, and unlike face-to-face human communication?
 * How has interpersonal communication changed as a result of the Internet?
* __Debatable/provocative:__
 * On the Internet does it matter if anyone knows that you are a dog?

## Topic: The Web as A Means of Collaboration & Communication

__Key Concept:__ Communities

__Related Concepts:__ Innovation, Collaboration

__Global Context:__ Scientific & Technical Innovation – The impact of scientific and technological advances on communities and environments.

__Statement of Inquiry:__ Innovation in web design enables communities on the Internet to communicate and collaborate across physical, political, and cultural boundaries.

The technical innovations that support the functions of the Internet and the World Wide Web have also enabled new forms of collaboration and community.

### Inquiry Questions

* __Factual:__
 * What are the essential facilities that make collaboration on the web possible?
 * What happens during an HTTP transaction?
* __Conceptual:__
 * Why does modern web design encourage a split between content (HTML) and style (CSS)?
* __Debatable/provocative:__
 * Are 'online communities' really communities?

### Design Objectives

__Criterion A: Investigating & Analyzing:__

 * i. explain and justify the need for a solution to a problem for a specified client/target audience
 * ii. identify and prioritize the primary and secondary research needed to develop a solution to the problem
 * iii. analyse a range of existing products that inspire a solution to the problem
 * iv. develop a detailed design brief, which summarizes the analysis of relevant research.

__Critierion B: Developing Ideas:__

 * i. develop a design specification, which clearly states the success criteria for the design of a solution
 * ii. develop a range of feasible design ideas, which can be correctly interpreted by others
 * iii. present the chosen design and justify its selection
 * iv. develop accurate and detailed planning drawings/ diagrams and outline the requirements for the creation of the chosen solution.

__Criterion C: Creating A Solution:__

 * i. construct a logical plan, which describes the efficient use of time and resources, sufficient for peers to be able to follow to create the solution
 * ii. demonstrate excellent technical skills when making the solution
 * iii. follow the plan to create the solution, which functions as intended
 * iv. fully justify changes made to the chosen design and plan when making the solution
 * v. present the solution as a whole.

__Criterion D: Evaluation:__

 * i. design detailed and relevant testing methods, which generate data, to measure the success of the solution
 * ii. critically evaluate the success of the solution against the design specification
 * iii. explain how the solution could be improved
 * iv. explain the impact of the solution on the client/target audience.

### Summative Assessment

In this design project the students take the knowledge they have been developing of how modern websites can be used to facilitate and support communities and the technical skills they have explored for creating websites and apply them to the design and prototyping of an actual website for a community of interest to them.

__Criterion A: Investigating & Analyzing:__ Identify a community that can be supported or facilitated by a web site. Describe how the community could communicate or collaborate online.

__Critierion B: Developing Ideas:__ Design a website with at least four pages (home page, plus three others) that implements your communication and/or collaboration ideas.

__Criterion C: Creating A Solution:__ Implement a prototype for the web site – there may be elements that don't work, for example searching a database, but a visitor should be able to see what the page would look like.

The website __must__ use HTML 5 and CSS (in a separate file or files). You have the option of creating your own CSS or using a CSS package such as Bootstrap.

For highest marks, incorporate simple JavaScript (for example an image rollover, or validate a form field) or place the site under version control using GitHub.

__Criterion D: Evaluation:__ Validate your website (HTML and CSS) and correct any errors detected. Describe the changes you made (you may do this either by a narrative or by including the validator output and a the output of 'git diff' after correcting the validation errors).
