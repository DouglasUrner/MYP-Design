Unit 3: Web Design
==================

## Topic: The Web as A Means of Collaboration & Communication

__Key Concept:__ Communities

__Related Concepts:__ Innovation, Collaboration

__Global Context:__ Scientific & Technical Innovation – The impact of scientific and technological advances on communities and environments.

__Statement of Inquiry:__ Innovation in web design enables communities on the Internet to communicate and collaborate across physical, political, and cultural boundaries.

### Inquiry Questions

* __Factual:__
 * What are the essential facilities that make collaboration on the web possible?
 * What happens during an HTTP transaction?
* __Conceptual:__
 * Why does modern web design encourage a split between content (HTML) and style (CSS)?
* __Debatable/provocative:__
 * Are 'online communities' really communities?

### Summative Assessment

__Criterion A: Investigating & Analyzing:__ Identify a community that can be supported or facilitated by a web site. Describe how the community could communicate or collaborate online.

__Critierion B: Developing Ideas:__ Design a website with at least four pages (home page, plus three others) that implements your communication and/or collaboration ideas.

__Criterion C: Creating A Solution:__ Implement a prototype for the web site – there may be elements that don't work, for example searching a database, but a visitor should be able to see what the page would look like.

The website __must__ use HTML 5 and CSS (in a separate file or files). You have the option of creating your own CSS or using a CSS package such as Bootstrap.

For highest marks, incorporate simple JavaScript (for example an image rollover, or validate a form field) or place the site under version control using GitHub.

__Criterion D: Evaluation:__ Validate your website (HTML and CSS) and correct any errors detected. Describe the changes you made (you may do this either by a narrative or by including the validator output and a the output of 'git diff' after correcting the validation errors).
