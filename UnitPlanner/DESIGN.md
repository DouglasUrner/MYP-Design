In principle this application functions as an electronic version of the MYP unit planner. It also takes advantage of having a database behind it to add some features and functionality.

Implementation plans/ideas:

* Multiple versions of a unit within the same entry. For example: there could be two versions based on different Key Concepts. Checkboxes allow you to select the components you want to use with your unit. This keeps all of the ideas for the unit organized in one place.
* You can also enter duplicate units.
* Freeze a unit – save a version as you have used it (book keeping records for the most part go here).
* Usage and creation records – just to make life simpler as the collection of units gets bigger.
* Resources may be added by hand, but they are also collected at each reasonable point – for example you may added resources to a Statement of Inquiry.
* Unit resources are organized first by those added directly to the resources section (presumably they are global). Then from those in selected components. Finally there could be an option to include a list of all resources associate with the unit.
* Drag and drop to organize items within a component (for example factual questions).
* Multiple users.
* Forking facility to allow users to duplicate a unit.
* Unit usage statistics.
* Associate units with courses.
* Coverage data (concepts, contexts, ATL, objectives).
* Edit for task specific descriptors.
* Common database for shared components (e.g., for concepts).
* Tagging (or some other facility) to allow you do things like a search for factual questions in a subject group or discipline or by course name.
